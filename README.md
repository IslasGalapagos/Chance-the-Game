## About

The simple game that offers to compete with the Random, and use a prediction as a weapon. You can use this game as a tool for procrastination, for example,  or for divination, or what you want. Have fun!

This project I designed and developed for fun and for some practice in the certain stack of technologies: *Webpack* + *Jest* + *Typescript* + *React* + *Redux* + *Emotion* + related libs. The project developed from scratch, via TDD.
